## About psychological counceling

I work in an integrative approach, with an emphasis on evidence-based behavioral approaches: 
- Acceptance and Responsibility Therapy (ACT)
- Focused Acceptance and Responsibility Therapy (fACT, a short-term version of ACT)
- Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression
- Non-religious Mindfulness practices.

I regularly undergo supervisions and personal therapy and take professional trainings and cources . I am a member of professional groups and societies, including the International Association for Contextual Behavioral Science ([ACBS](https://contextualscience.org/)).

I teach clients to overcome procrastination in my online groups, train in mindfulness and emotional self-regulation and teach clients to use AI for wellbeing psychological flourishing.

## Problems I work with

- Procrastination
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Burnout
- Relationships with others and oneself
- Loneliness
- Loss and grieving
- Low self-esteem
- Loss of meaning, values, “purpose”, belief


## Counseling Format

I work only online through the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). The duration of one session is 60 minutes. During our conversations, we might do certain exercises, mindfulness practices, visualization and controlled breathing exercises, and even certain types of light physical activities for better self-regulation, but the majority of session consists of me asking questions for reflection and client answering them to raise awareness, mindfulness and integration.

## Duration of work

Due to immense complexity of human psyche and large number of individual differences, it is impossible to say how long the treatment can last. Depending on the history and depth of the problem, it might be weeks, months or years.


## Education

**Please note**. I am not a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.  I am not a doctor, I do not have a medical degree, I do not diagnose or prescribe medications. My specialty is talk therapy. Whenever needed, I work in coordination for other specialists (psychiatrists, doctors, trainers).
